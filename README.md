# LLM-based lifestyle advice and user question-answering
Repository containing Python code for building a pipeline for LLM (GPT-4o)-based user question-answering on lifestyle advice, combining insights from health diary data and RAG from trustworthy sources. 

## Features
- Processes a user's daily diary data to generate personalized lifestyle advice
- Creates a RAG database from a list of trustworthy sources
- Supports Azure OpenAI
- Modular design through LangChain

## Important
Though we share the source code of our pipeline in this way, we cannot share the user data itself nor (the sources for) the RAG database due to privacy and intellectual property considerations.
